    "*Purpose*: Variability is an unavoidable reality of engineering: Physical systems do not behave in identical ways, even under similar circumstances. It is important to draw a distinction between sources of variability that corrupt measurements, and other sources of variability that can genuinely change physical outcomes: real vs erroneous variability. Therefore, we should analyze real and erroneous sources of variability differently---this can lead to more accurate data analysis and more efficient engineering designs.\n"

    "4. (Error) Property measurements typically involve a conversion from mechanical phenomena to electrical signals. However, we tend to take measurements in an electromagnetically dirty environment: Ambient EM interference can induce electrical noise that corrupts a measurement.
