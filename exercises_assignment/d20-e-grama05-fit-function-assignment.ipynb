However, we may not have the means to *set values* for those physical inputs. Or, we might be using the model to *infer* values for some physical inputs (i.e. a measurement model). In this case, we can use statistical tools to *fit* the parameters in a function using a dataset. This exercise will introduce these ideas with a particular case study.\n"

This is because our model assumes a *linear* drag law $F_d \\propto - m \\tau s$, while in reality the data were generated using a *quadratic* drag law $F_d \\propto - m b s^2$. This qualitative difference between the model and the data-generating process leads to a mismatch between predicted and measured values that we can't overcome without changing the model's *form*.\n",
