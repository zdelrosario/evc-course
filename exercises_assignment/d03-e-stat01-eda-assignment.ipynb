    "*Purpose*: *Exploratory Data Analysis* (EDA) is a __crucial__ skill for a practicing data scientist. Unfortunately, much like human-centered design EDA is hard to teach. This is because EDA is **not** a strict procedure, so much as it is a **mindset**. Also, much like human-centered design, EDA is an *iterative, nonlinear process*. There are two key principles to keep in mind when doing EDA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Curiosity: Generate lots of ideas and hypotheses about your data.\n",
    "2. Skepticism: Remain unconvinced of those ideas, unless you can find credible\n",
    "  patterns to support them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since EDA is both *crucial* and *difficult*, we will practice doing EDA *a lot* in this course!\n"
