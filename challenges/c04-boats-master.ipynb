    "*Purpose*: Exploratory model analysis is a way to learn about a model and thus the scenario that it describes. However, computationally-expensive models are challenging to study with EMA, as every function evaluation costs us a lot of compute time. This challenge is about applying EMA ideas to learn about boat hull design, and about interfacing with a more computationally-complex simulation code.\n"
